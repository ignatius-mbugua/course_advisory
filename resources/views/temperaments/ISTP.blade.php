                            ISTPs love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the 
                            world around them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity. People with this 
                            personality type are natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the 
                            useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, and learning from their environment 
                            as they go. Often mechanics and engineers, ISTPs find no greater joy than in 
                            getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, 
                            just a little bit better than they were before.
