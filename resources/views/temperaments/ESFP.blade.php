                            ESFPs take a hands-on approach in most things. Because they learn more by doing 
                            than by studying or reading, they tend to rush into things, learning by 
                            interacting with their environment. They usually dislike theory and written 
                            explanations. Traditional schools can be difficult for ESFPs, although they 
                            tend to do well when the subject of study interests them, or when they see the 
                            relevance of a subject and are allowed to interact with people.
