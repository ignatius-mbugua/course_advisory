                            INTPs pride themselves on their inventiveness and creativity, their unique 
                            perspective and vigorous intellect. Usually known as the philosopher, the 
                            architect, or the dreamy professor, INTPs have been responsible for many 
                            scientific discoveries throughout history.
                            They love patterns, and spotting discrepancies between statements could almost 
                            be described as a hobby, making it a bad idea to lie to an INTP. This makes it 
                            ironic that INTPs’ word should always be taken with a grain of salt – it’s not 
                            that they are dishonest, but people with the INTP personality type tend to share 
                            thoughts that are not fully developed, using others as a sounding board for ideas 
                            and theories in a debate against themselves rather than as actual conversation 
                            partners.
